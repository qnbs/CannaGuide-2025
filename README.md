## ‚≠ê Project Philosophy

CannaGuide 2025 is built upon a set of core principles designed to deliver a best-in-class experience:

*   **Offline First**: Your garden doesn't stop when your internet does. The app is engineered to be **100% functional offline**, ensuring you always have access to your data and tools.
*   **Performance is Key**: A fluid, responsive UI is non-negotiable. Heavy lifting, like the complex plant simulation, is offloaded to a **Web Worker** to keep the interface smooth and instantaneous.
*   **Data Sovereignty**: Your data is yours. The ability to **export and import your entire application state** gives you complete control, ownership, and peace of mind.
*   **AI as a Co-pilot**: We leverage AI not as a gimmick, but as a powerful tool to provide **actionable, context-aware insights** that truly assist the grower at every stage.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. The Grow Room (`Plants` View)
Your command center for managing and simulating up to three simultaneous grows.

*   **Ultra-Realistic Simulation Engine**: Experience a state-of-the-art simulation based on **VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)**, biomass-scaled resource consumption, and a structural growth model.
*   **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Upload a photo of your plant to get an instant AI-based diagnosis, complete with immediate actions, long-term solutions, and preventative advice.
*   **AI Plant Advisor**: Get proactive, data-driven advice from Gemini AI based on your plant's real-time vitals. All recommendations can be archived with full **CRUD** functionality.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: Track every action‚Äîfrom watering and feeding to training and pest control‚Äîin a detailed, filterable journal for each plant.
*   **Dynamic Task & Problem Generation**: The simulation engine automatically creates tasks (e.g., "Water Plant") and flags problems (e.g., "Nutrient Deficiency") based on the plant's evolving condition.

### 2. The Strain Encyclopedia (`Strains` View)
Your central knowledge hub, designed for deep exploration with **offline-first** access.

*   **Vast Library**: Access detailed information on **over 480 cannabis strains**.
*   **Interactive Genealogy Tree**: Visualize the complete genetic lineage of any strain in an interactive tree diagram.
*   **High-Performance Search & Filtering**: Instantly find strains with an IndexedDB-powered full-text search and advanced multi-select filters for THC/CBD range, flowering time, aroma, and more.
*   **Personal Strain Collection**: Enjoy full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality to add and manage your own custom strains.
*   **AI Grow Tips**: Generate unique, AI-powered cultivation advice for any strain based on your experience level and goals, then manage it in a dedicated "Tips" archive.
*   **Flexible Data Export**: Export your selected or filtered strain lists in multiple formats, including **PDF, CSV, and JSON**.

### 3. The Library (`Knowledge` & `Help` Views)
Your complete resource for learning and problem-solving.

*   **Context-Aware AI Mentor**: Ask growing questions to the AI Mentor, which leverages your active plant's data for tailored advice. All conversations are archived with full **CRUD** support.
*   **Breeding Lab**: Cross your high-quality collected seeds to create entirely new, unique hybrid strains that are permanently added to your personal library.
*   **Interactive Sandbox**: Run "what-if" scenarios, like comparing Topping vs. LST on a clone of your plant, to visualize the impact of different training techniques over an accelerated 14-day simulation without risking your real plants.
*   **Comprehensive Guides**: Access a built-in grower's lexicon, visual guides for common techniques, and an extensive FAQ section.

### 4. Platform-Wide Features
*   **Full PWA & Offline Capability**: Install the app on your device for a native-like experience. The robust Service Worker ensures **100% offline functionality**, including access to all data and AI archives.
*   **Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)**: A power-user tool for instant, click-free navigation and actions across the entire application.
*   **Complete Data Sovereignty**: Export *all* your app data (plants, settings, archives, custom strains) to a single JSON file for **backup**. Import it later to **restore** your state on any device.
*   **Advanced Accessibility**: Features a **Dyslexia-Friendly Font**, **Reduced Motion** mode, and integrated **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality for key content.

## üíª Technical Deep Dive

CannaGuide 2025 is built on a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack designed for performance and offline-first reliability.

*   **Core Framework**: **React 19 & TypeScript** provide a modern, type-safe, and performant user interface.
*   **State Management**: **Redux Toolkit** serves as the single source of truth for the entire application state. This centralized approach ensures predictable state transitions, simplifies debugging with tools like Redux DevTools, and makes state persistence straightforward.
*   **AI Integration**: **Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)** powers all intelligent features, using the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for its optimal balance of speed, cost, and its powerful ability to deliver structured JSON output.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**:
    *   **RTK Query** manages all interactions with the Gemini API, providing caching, automatic re-fetching, and streamlined loading/error state management.
    *   The complex plant growth simulation runs in a **Web Worker (`simulation.worker.ts`)**, ensuring the main UI thread remains responsive and smooth, even during intensive background calculations.
*   **Data Persistence**: A robust **IndexedDB** strategy ensures data integrity and offline availability.
    *   The entire Redux state is persisted to IndexedDB via a listener middleware, providing seamless state hydration on app startup.
    *   Large static assets, like the strain library and the full-text search index, are managed in a separate IndexedDB database for optimal performance and to avoid bloating the main state object.
*   **PWA & Offline Capability**: A **Service Worker (`sw.js`)** implements a "Cache First, then Network" strategy, making the application fully installable and functional without an internet connection.
*   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** enables a rapid, utility-first approach to building a consistent and responsive design system that is easy to maintain and customize.

## ü§ñ Development with AI Studio & Open Source

This application was developed entirely with **Google's AI Studio**. The entire process, from the initial project scaffolding to implementing complex features like the Redux state management and the Web Worker simulation, was driven by iterative prompts in natural language.

This project is also fully open source. Dive into the code, fork the project, or contribute on GitHub. See firsthand how natural language can build sophisticated applications.

*   **Fork the project in AI Studio:** [https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1_F6ArMCdXQt-1fWzTf0R6Sgge9lXxz4-](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1_F6ArMCdXQt-1fWzTf0R6Sgge9lXxz4-)
