## 🚀 Development with AI Studio

This application was developed entirely using **Google's AI Studio**, an innovative platform that enables the creation and modification of complex, feature-rich web applications through natural language commands.

The entire process, from scaffolding the initial project structure to implementing the dynamic plant simulation, integrating the Gemini API, and designing the user interface, was guided by iterative prompts. This approach demonstrates the power of AI in modern software development, significantly accelerating prototyping and allowing for a focus on user experience and functionality.
