## ⭐ Project Philosophy

CannaGuide 2025 is built upon a set of core principles designed to deliver a best-in-class experience:

> **Offline First**: Your garden doesn't stop when your internet does. The app is engineered to be **100% functional offline**. All actions (like logging watering or adding notes) performed while offline are automatically queued and synced in the background via the browser's SyncManager API once your connection is restored. All your data, notes, and AI archives are stored locally and accessible anytime, anywhere.

> **Performance is Key**: A fluid, responsive UI is non-negotiable. Heavy lifting, like the complex, multi-plant simulation, is offloaded to a dedicated **Web Worker**, ensuring the user interface remains smooth and instantaneous at all times.

> **Data Sovereignty**: Your data is yours, period. The ability to **export and import your entire application state** as a single file gives you complete control, ownership, and peace of mind for backups or device migration.

> **AI as a Co-pilot**: We leverage the Google Gemini API not as a gimmick, but as a powerful tool to provide **actionable, context-aware insights**. From diagnosing a sick plant from a photo to generating a custom equipment list, AI serves to genuinely assist the grower at every stage.

### Gemini Service Abstraction (`geminiService.ts`)

As noted in the [project's DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/qnbs/CannaGuide-2025), the `geminiService.ts` file is a critical component that acts as a central abstraction layer for all communication with the Google Gemini API. This design decouples the API logic from the UI components and the Redux state management layer (RTK Query), making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to test.

All AI-powered features in the application route their requests through this service. RTK Query hooks (e.g., `useGetPlantAdviceMutation`) are configured to use a `queryFn` that calls the corresponding method in `geminiService`.

**Key Responsibilities & Methods:**

*   **Initialization**: The service initializes a single `GoogleGenAI` instance, ensuring the API key is handled in one central location.
*   **Context & Localization**: It uses helper functions (`formatPlantContextForPrompt`, `createLocalizedPrompt`) to automatically format real-time plant data into a consistent context report and prepend the correct language instruction (`"IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be exclusively in English..."`) to every prompt sent to the API. This ensures all AI responses are tailored and correctly localized.
*   **Structured JSON Output**: For features requiring structured data, the service leverages Gemini's JSON mode.
    *   `getEquipmentRecommendation`, `diagnosePlant`, `getMentorResponse`, `getStrainTips`, `generateDeepDive`: These methods pass a `responseSchema` in the request configuration. This forces the model to return a valid JSON object that matches the defined TypeScript types (e.g., `Recommendation`, `PlantDiagnosisResponse`), eliminating the need for fragile string parsing on the client side.
*   **Multimodal Input (Vision)**:
    *   `diagnosePlant`: This method demonstrates multimodal capabilities by accepting a Base64-encoded image and combining it with the text-based context report into a multipart request. The `gemini-2.5-flash` model then analyzes both the image and the data to provide a diagnosis.
*   **Image Generation**:
    *   `generateStrainImage`: This method uses the specialized `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model and configures `responseModalities: [Modality.IMAGE]` to generate a unique, artistic image for a given strain, which is then used in the AI Grow Tips feature.
*   **Model Selection**: The service intelligently selects the appropriate model for the task. It uses the cost-effective and fast `gemini-2.5-flash` for most text and vision tasks, but switches to the more powerful `gemini-2.5-pro` for the complex `generateDeepDive` feature, which requires more advanced reasoning.
*   **Error Handling**: Each method includes `try...catch` blocks that wrap the API call. On failure, it logs the error and throws a new, user-friendly error message (using keys from the translation files, e.g., `'ai.error.diagnostics'`), which RTK Query then provides to the UI for graceful display.

### Project Structure
The codebase is organized into logical directories to promote maintainability and scalability:
-   `components/`: Contains all React components, organized by view or commonality.
-   `stores/`: Home to the Redux store, slices, selectors, and middleware.
-   `services/`: Houses business logic, including the simulation engine, database interactions, and API service wrappers.
-   `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks for shared logic like focus traps, PWA installation, and more.
-   `data/`: Stores static data, such as the strain library, lexicon, and FAQ content.
-   `locales/`: Contains all internationalization (i18n) translation files.

## 🛠️ Local Development (Developer Guide)

This project is designed to run within Google's AI Studio, which handles the development server and environment variables. However, you can run it locally with a standard Node.js setup.

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.studio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qnbs/CannaGuide-2025.git
    cd CannaGuide-2025
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and add your API key:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    > **Note**: The app uses Vite, which exposes `VITE_` prefixed variables to the client. The application code will need to access it as `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`. (This has been abstracted to `process.env.API_KEY` for compatibility with AI Studio).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

*   **AI Features Not Working**: This is almost always due to a missing or invalid Gemini API key. Ensure your environment variable (`VITE_API_KEY` for local dev) is correctly set up and the key is valid. Check your browser's developer console for any `4xx` errors related to the Google API.
*   **App Not Updating (PWA Caching)**: If you've made changes but don't see them, the Service Worker might be serving a cached version.
    1.  Open your browser's developer tools.
    2.  Go to the `Application` tab.
    3.  Find `Service Workers`, check "Update on reload", and click "Unregister".
    4.  Go to `Storage`, click "Clear site data".
    5.  Refresh the page.
*   **Data Corruption**: If the application state becomes corrupted, you can perform a hard reset by navigating to `Settings > Data Management > Reset All App Data`. **Warning: This will delete all your local data.**

## ⭐ Projektphilosophie

CannaGuide 2025 basiert auf einer Reihe von Kernprinzipien, die darauf ausgelegt sind, ein erstklassiges Erlebnis zu bieten:

> **Offline First**: Ihr Garten macht keine Pause, wenn Ihre Internetverbindung ausfällt. Die App ist so konzipiert, dass sie **100% offline funktionsfähig** ist. Alle Aktionen (wie das Protokollieren von Gießvorgängen oder das Hinzufügen von Notizen), die offline durchgeführt werden, werden automatisch in eine Warteschlange gestellt und im Hintergrund über die SyncManager-API des Browsers synchronisiert, sobald Ihre Verbindung wiederhergestellt ist. Alle Ihre Daten, Notizen und KI-Archive sind lokal gespeichert und jederzeit und überall zugänglich.

> **Leistung ist entscheidend**: Eine flüssige, reaktionsschnelle Benutzeroberfläche ist unerlässlich. Rechenintensive Aufgaben, wie die komplexe Pflanzensimulation, werden in einen **Web Worker** ausgelagert, um die Hauptoberfläche geschmeidig und reaktionsschnell zu halten.

> **Datensouveränität**: Ihre Daten gehören Ihnen. Die Möglichkeit, Ihren **gesamten Anwendungszustand zu exportieren und zu importieren**, gibt Ihnen vollständige Kontrolle, Eigentum und Sicherheit.

> **KI als Co-Pilot**: Wir nutzen KI nicht als Gimmick, sondern als leistungsstarkes Werkzeug, um **umsetzbare, kontextbezogene Einblicke** zu liefern, die den Züchter in jeder Phase wirklich unterstützen.

### Gemini-Service-Abstraktion (`geminiService.ts`)

Wie im [DeepWiki des Projekts](https://deepwiki.com/qnbs/CannaGuide-2025) erwähnt, ist die Datei `geminiService.ts` eine entscheidende Komponente, die als zentrale Abstraktionsschicht für die gesamte Kommunikation mit der Google Gemini API fungiert. Dieses Design entkoppelt die API-Logik von den UI-Komponenten und der Redux-Zustandsverwaltung (RTK Query), was den Code sauberer, wartbarer und einfacher testbar macht.

Alle KI-gestützten Funktionen in der Anwendung leiten ihre Anfragen über diesen Dienst. RTK Query-Hooks (z. B. `useGetPlantAdviceMutation`) sind so konfiguriert, dass sie eine `queryFn` verwenden, die die entsprechende Methode im `geminiService` aufruft.

**Hauptverantwortlichkeiten & Methoden:**

*   **Initialisierung**: Der Dienst initialisiert eine einzige `GoogleGenAI`-Instanz und stellt sicher, dass der API-Schlüssel an einem zentralen Ort gehandhabt wird.
*   **Kontext & Lokalisierung**: Er verwendet Hilfsfunktionen (`formatPlantContextForPrompt`, `createLocalizedPrompt`), um Echtzeit-Pflanzendaten automatisch in einen konsistenten Kontextbericht zu formatieren und jeder an die API gesendeten Anfrage die korrekte Sprachanweisung (`"WICHTIG: Deine gesamte Antwort muss ausschließlich auf Deutsch sein..."`) voranzustellen. Dies stellt sicher, dass alle KI-Antworten maßgeschneidert und korrekt lokalisiert sind.
*   **Strukturierte JSON-Ausgabe**: Für Funktionen, die strukturierte Daten erfordern, nutzt der Dienst den JSON-Modus von Gemini.
    *   `getEquipmentRecommendation`, `diagnosePlant`, `getMentorResponse`, `getStrainTips`, `generateDeepDive`: Diese Methoden übergeben ein `responseSchema` in der Anfragekonfiguration. Dies zwingt das Modell, ein gültiges JSON-Objekt zurückzugeben, das den definierten TypeScript-Typen entspricht (z. B. `Recommendation`, `PlantDiagnosisResponse`), wodurch ein fehleranfälliges Parsen von Zeichenketten auf der Client-Seite vermieden wird.
*   **Multimodale Eingabe (Vision)**:
    *   `diagnosePlant`: Diese Methode demonstriert multimodale Fähigkeiten, indem sie ein Base64-kodiertes Bild akzeptiert und es mit dem textbasierten Kontextbericht zu einer mehrteiligen Anfrage kombiniert. Das `gemini-2.5-flash`-Modell analysiert dann sowohl das Bild als auch die Daten, um eine Diagnose zu stellen.
*   **Bilderzeugung**:
    *   `generateStrainImage`: Diese Methode verwendet das spezialisierte `gemini-2.5-flash-image`-Modell und konfiguriert `responseModalities: [Modality.IMAGE]`, um ein einzigartiges, künstlerisches Bild für eine bestimmte Sorte zu generieren, das dann in der Funktion "KI-Anbau-Tipps" verwendet wird.
*   **Modellauswahl**: Der Dienst wählt intelligent das passende Modell für die jeweilige Aufgabe aus. Er verwendet das kostengünstige und schnelle `gemini-2.5-flash` für die meisten Text- und Bildanalyseaufgaben, wechselt aber zum leistungsfähigeren `gemini-2.5-pro` für die komplexe `generateDeepDive`-Funktion, die fortgeschrittenere Schlussfolgerungen erfordert.
*   **Fehlerbehandlung**: Jede Methode enthält `try...catch`-Blöcke, die den API-Aufruf umschließen. Bei einem Fehler wird der Fehler protokolliert und eine neue, benutzerfreundliche Fehlermeldung (unter Verwendung von Schlüsseln aus den Übersetzungsdateien, z. B. `'ai.error.diagnostics'`) geworfen, die RTK Query dann der Benutzeroberfläche zur anmutigen Anzeige zur Verfügung stellt.

## 🛠️ Lokale Entwicklung (Entwicklerhandbuch)

Dieses Projekt ist für die Ausführung im Google AI Studio konzipiert, das den Entwicklungsserver und die Umgebungsvariablen bereitstellt. Sie können es jedoch auch lokal mit einem Standard-Node.js-Setup ausführen.

### Voraussetzungen
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x oder neuer empfohlen)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (normalerweise bei Node.js enthalten)
*   Ein **Google Gemini API Key**. Diesen erhalten Sie im [Google AI Studio](https://ai.studio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Einrichtung
1.  **Repository klonen:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qnbs/CannaGuide-2025.git
    cd CannaGuide-2025
    ```

2.  **Abhängigkeiten installieren:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Umgebungsvariablen einrichten:**
    Die Anwendung benötigt einen Google Gemini API-Schlüssel. Erstellen Sie eine `.env`-Datei im Stammverzeichnis des Projekts:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    Öffnen Sie die `.env`-Datei und fügen Sie Ihren API-Schlüssel hinzu:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=DEIN_GEMINI_API_SCHLÜSSEL
    ```
    > **Hinweis**: Die App verwendet Vite, das `VITE_`-präfixierte Variablen für den Client verfügbar macht. Der Anwendungscode greift darauf über `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` zu (für die Kompatibilität mit AI Studio auf `process.env.API_KEY` abstrahiert).

4.  **Entwicklungsserver starten:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Dies startet den Vite-Entwicklungsserver, typischerweise unter `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## 🤔 Fehlerbehebung (Troubleshooting)

*   **KI-Funktionen funktionieren nicht**: Dies liegt fast immer an einem fehlenden oder ungültigen Gemini API-Schlüssel. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre Umgebungsvariable (`VITE_API_KEY` für lokale Entwicklung) korrekt eingerichtet ist. Überprüfen Sie die Entwicklerkonsole Ihres Browsers auf `4xx`-Fehler.
*   **App aktualisiert sich nicht (PWA-Caching)**: Wenn Sie Änderungen vorgenommen haben, diese aber nicht sehen, könnte der Service Worker eine zwischengespeicherte Version ausliefern.
    1.  Öffnen Sie die Entwicklertools Ihres Browsers.
    2.  Gehen Sie zum Tab `Anwendung` (Application).
    3.  Suchen Sie `Service Workers`, aktivieren Sie "Update on reload" und klicken Sie auf "Unregister".
    4.  Gehen Sie zu `Speicher` (Storage) und klicken Sie auf "Site data löschen".
    5.  Aktualisieren Sie die Seite.
*   **Datenprobleme**: Sollte der Zustand der Anwendung beschädigt werden, können Sie einen Hard-Reset durchführen, indem Sie zu `Einstellungen > Datenverwaltung > Alle App-Daten zurücksetzen` navigieren. **Achtung: Dies löscht alle Ihre lokalen Daten.**
