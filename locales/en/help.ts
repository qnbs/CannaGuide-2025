  phValue: {
    question: 'Why is the pH value so important?',
    answer: 'The pH of your water and medium determines which nutrients the plant can absorb. An incorrect pH leads to nutrient lockout, even if enough fertilizer is present. For soil, the ideal range is 6.0-7.0; for hydro/coco, it\'s 5.5-6.5.'
  },
  yellowLeaves: {
    question: 'What do yellow leaves mean?',
    answer: 'Yellow leaves can have many causes. If the lower, older leaves turn yellow, it is often a nitrogen deficiency. If spots appear on upper, younger leaves, it could be a deficiency of immobile nutrients like calcium or a pH problem. Overwatering is also a common cause.'
  },
  whenToHarvest: {
    question: 'How do I know when to harvest?',
    answer: 'The best indicator is the trichomes (the resin glands) on the flowers. Under a microscope, most trichomes should be milky-white, with a few amber ones. Clear trichomes are immature; too many amber ones indicate an overripe harvest with a more sedating effect.'
  },
  lightDistance: {
    question: 'How far should the lamp be from the plants?',
    answer: 'This depends heavily on the lamp type and wattage. For modern LED lamps, a rule of thumb is: Seedlings: 60-90 cm, Vegetative: 45-60 cm, Flowering: 30-45 cm. Observe your plants closely. If they are stretching excessively, the lamp is too far. If the upper leaves show signs of burning (yellow, dry tips), it is too close.'
