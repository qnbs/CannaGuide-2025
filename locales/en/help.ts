          q: 'What is Caryophyllene?',
          a: 'Beta-Caryophyllene has a peppery, spicy, and woody aroma. It is the only terpene that also binds to CB2 receptors, giving it anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It is found in black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon.'

        {
            q: 'What are flavonoids?',
            a: 'Flavonoids are a group of phytonutrients found in almost all fruits and vegetables. They are responsible for the vivid colors in many plants, like the blue in blueberries or the red in raspberries. In cannabis, they not only contribute to coloration but also have their own health benefits and contribute to the entourage effect.'

        {
            q: 'What is the role of flavonoids in cannabis?',
            a: 'In cannabis, flavonoids contribute to the overall experience by influencing aroma and flavor. They also work synergistically with cannabinoids and terpenes. Some flavonoids unique to cannabis, called "cannaflavins," are being studied for their potent anti-inflammatory properties.'

        {
            q: 'Can you give some examples of flavonoids?',
            a: 'Certainly! Quercetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, is known for its antioxidant and anti-allergy properties. Apigenin, found in chamomile, has anxiolytic effects. The unique cannaflavins A, B, and C are being investigated for anti-inflammatory potential reportedly stronger than aspirin.'
