  topping: {
    title: 'Topping a Plant',
    description: 'Topping is a high-stress training (HST) technique where the top growth of the main stem is removed. This encourages the plant to grow two new main colas, leading to a bushier shape and potentially higher yields.',

  phValue: {
    question: 'Why is pH value so important?',
    answer: 'The pH of your water and medium determines which nutrients the plant can absorb. An incorrect pH "locks out" certain nutrients, even if they are present in the soil, leading to deficiencies. For soil, the ideal range is 6.0-6.8; for coco/hydro, it\'s 5.5-6.5.'
  },
  yellowLeaves: {
    question: 'What do yellow leaves mean?',
    answer: 'Yellowing leaves (chlorosis) can have many causes. If it starts at the bottom and moves up, it\'s often a nitrogen deficiency, common in the vegetative stage. Splotchy yellow spots can indicate a calcium or magnesium deficiency. Overwatering is also a very common cause as it suffocates the roots.'
  },
  whenToHarvest: {
    question: 'How do I know when to harvest?',
    answer: 'The best indicator is the trichomes (the tiny resin glands). Viewed with a magnifier, most should be milky/cloudy for peak potency. Clear trichomes are not yet ready, while amber-colored ones indicate a more sedating effect. The color of the pistils (hairs) is a less accurate indicator.'
  },
  lightDistance: {
    question: 'How far should my light be from my seedlings?',
    answer: 'Seedlings are very delicate. Keep the light further away than you would for mature plants to avoid light burn. A good starting point for most LEDs is 24-30 inches (60-75 cm). Watch the plant: if it\'s stretching (getting tall and thin), the light is too far. If the leaves show signs of burning or bleaching, it\'s too close.'
