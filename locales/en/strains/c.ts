Its aroma is its most distinctive feature: an extremely sharp, pungent smell of diesel, chemicals, and earthy pine, which became known as 'gas' or 'fuel' and defined an entire category of flavor profiles. Due to its potency and unique terpene profile, it is a strain better suited for experienced consumers.",
