This makes it a versatile strain that can be enjoyed both during the day and in the evening. The aroma is complex and enticing, a blend of fresh mint and sweet cookies, underscored by earthy, piney, and coffee-like notes. Due to its high THC content, it is one of the parent strains for many modern high-potency hybrids like Cap Junky.",
