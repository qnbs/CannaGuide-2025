        "description": "Triangle Kush is a legendary and highly potent indica strain originating from Florida, named after the state's three major cannabis-producing cities: Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa. Believed to be a direct descendant or a very close phenotype of the original OG Kush, it is considered a cornerstone of many modern Kush and OG varieties. The effect is powerful and balanced, starting with an uplifting cerebral rush that sparks creativity and conversation, before settling into a deep, full-body relaxation that can effectively manage pain and stress without being completely incapacitating. Its aroma is a classic and complex OG profile, dominated by notes of spicy fuel, earthy pine, and sour lemon."
